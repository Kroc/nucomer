Notes from Cadaver
------------------

(Somewhere in 1999)
Compiled on a 32-bit compiler to make generating big programs possible.

(August 2002)
Fixed in August 2002 to accept negative constants when compiled with
GCC/Linux. All ulongs in the source were replaced with longs.

(January 2004)
Now the assembler defaults to 3 passes, verboseness level 3 and aborts on the
first error it encounters.
