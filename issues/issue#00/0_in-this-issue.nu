----------------------------------------------
In this, the 0th issue -- zero because it can't be a true magazine until it's had feedback and outside input -- we look at the code & design of the magazine outfit itself; the challenges of even getting some text on the screen.

In ~"Help! My Interrupt Crashed!"~ I explain how an incremental approach to implementing custom interrupts will only lead to nightmarish bugs and provide a breakdown of the C64's interrupt "gotcha's".

~"BSOD64: BRK Dancing"~ introduces our C64 debugger designed for users writing their first software for the platform, and explains how debugging works on the C64.
