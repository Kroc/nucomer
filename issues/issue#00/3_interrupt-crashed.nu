:: Help! My Interrupt Crashed!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you first learn to program the Commodore 64 there comes a point when you need to do an effect that requires raster interrupts -- that is, changing some video property (sprites, colours, text/bitmap mode) somewhere in the middle of the screen.

You've looked up some examples and, unfortunately, the information is very confusing and incomplete so you begin to tread forward lightly, modifying the C64's interrupts a little bit at a time.

You'll likely have succeeded in getting what you wanted working, but then as you press ahead with the more straight-forward parts of your program, things become horribly unstable with random crashes and major graphical glitches and it's not long before the whole thing goes down in flames.
